# Term-Project-COP3503
Project group 34 - Natural Language Processing
# We did it!
### Thanks for everyone's help. The master branch now holds the complete project. This build will be used in the presentation on thursday, if everyone is happy with it. Have a good break.
## Hi everyone!
**The program now compliles and builds.** Use the command:  

`g++ -o main -Wall -std=c++11 builder.cpp controller.cpp word.cpp WordSubclasses.cpp`    

to create a file named "main" and run it with    

`./main`    

This only works on a Unix system.

### Full list of classes:
1. Builder(main) :heavy_check_mark:
2. Controller :heavy_check_mark:
3. Word (with WordList and WordBank linked lists) :heavy_check_mark:
4. Noun Subclasses:
   - Conjunction :heavy_check_mark:
   - Preposition :heavy_check_mark:
   - Noun :heavy_check_mark:
   - Proper Noun :heavy_check_mark:
   - Verb :heavy_check_mark:
   - Adjective :heavy_check_mark:
   - Adverb :heavy_check_mark:

#### All classes should have both .cpp and .h files, with delcarations in the header and implementations in the cpp file. Once all classes have been created, we will schedule a full group meet up to determine how inheritance should be organized and to debug/fix errors (probably friday or saturday). Let's continue to be in discord in case anyone needs help.
